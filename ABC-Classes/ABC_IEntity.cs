    /// All ABC components access this interface when dealing with non ABC Generated Objects (Entities) any property in this class can be changed as long as it returns the same type of value it expects. 
    /// An example of this is if a user doesn't want to use StateManager for Health Management so they can plug in their own health component property here.
    /// Then when ABC calls this interface to reduce health it will simply effect the new component. 
    /// This also allows for different target systems to be used if desired. As long as these methods returns the same type of property then any of this class can be changed and it will still easily fit in with the rest of ABC.
